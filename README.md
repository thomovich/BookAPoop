# BookAPoop
App for booking and renting a possibility to poop
Motivation and description:
The general idea of the app is to create more ways for share economy to work, we dont have to settle with only cars or apartments. The sky is the limit for share economy therefore
the app BookAPoop has been invented where you can book or rent a toilet to poop on.

The motivation for the project came from experience going to concerts or festivals in big cities where the public bathrooms often are very disgusting and not that great to use.
So this will give the users the opportunity to go inside a place get the warmth and have a nice bathroom break or even take a shower if that is needed, and since the place
is a private residence the quality of the visit will often be very high, and with a rating system and the renters having to put out a photo of the bathroom before hand no 
renter will feel cheated after booking a bathroom visit.

M: The app must have an interactive map where you will be able to see nearby places where you can book a place to go to the bathroom, as well as a system for creating for renting
and booking. The app must have a layout that is easy for the users to find there way around it. As well as photos of the bathroom will be included in the renting page. 
S: The app should have a direct messaging service between booker and renter. The app should have multiple payment options.
C: The app could have VR support so people can experience it before they actually enter the place.
W: The app will not have ads, the main source of income will be a cut of the transaction.
